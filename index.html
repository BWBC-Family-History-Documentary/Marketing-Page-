          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>
            We think of you when we think family. We had you in mind when
            building this site. To be easily accessible by all, that's the way
            we think. You shouldn't be held back from your right to your
            ancestry if it has anything to do with a disability. We hope 
            you're as excited about The Family Scrapbook as we are when
            using it.
